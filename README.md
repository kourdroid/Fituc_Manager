# 🎭 FITUC Manager – Festival Registration System

## 📌 Project Overview
FITUC Manager is a web-based application developed to **digitize and streamline the artist registration process** for the **Festival International de Théâtre Universitaire de Casablanca (FITUC)**. This platform replaces the traditional method of submitting applications via email, offering a **more structured and efficient workflow** for both participants and festival organizers.

## 🔍 Challenges & Pain Points
The traditional registration process required artists and theatre troupes to **fill out a DOCX application form** and submit it via email. This approach posed several challenges:

- ❌ **Manual Processing** – Organizers had to handle applications individually, leading to inefficiencies.
- ❌ **Data Management Issues** – Tracking and organizing participant details was cumbersome.
- ❌ **High Risk of Errors** – Missing information or incorrect formatting often required follow-ups.
- ❌ **Lack of Accessibility** – Applicants had no way to track the status of their submissions.

FITUC Manager provides a **centralized, user-friendly platform** that simplifies the application process through:

### 🎭 **For Participants (Artists & Theatre Groups)**
✅ **Seamless Online Registration** – Submit applications directly via the web platform.
✅ **Document & Media Upload** – Attach necessary files (e.g., play scripts, technical requirements).
✅ **Application Tracking** – View the status of submissions in real time.

### 🏛 **For Organizers & Admins**
✅ **Efficient Application Management** – Access, review, and manage submissions from a unified dashboard.
✅ **Structured Data Storage** – All applications are stored securely in a PostgreSQL database.
✅ **Performance & Play Management** – Track scheduled performances and technical details.
